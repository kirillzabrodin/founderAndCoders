# founderAndCoders
A website for FFC to support my application for the autumn 2018 course.


Code for my website will be in this repo as well as any other resources used. I will also be writing any issues I have or any features I am unable to add during the course of creating in order to have stuff to research and bring to interview. Any extra info or tools that I find I will keep a list of and share with FFC.
