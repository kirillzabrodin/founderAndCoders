			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Kirill and I'm a 20 year old Russian immigrant to the UK. I have been living and studying in the UK since the age of 9. My journey with code began when I was 10, with my science teacher introducing me to BBC Basic. Throughout my life I did coding in Python, both for personal projects, and school. </p><hr />

			<p>I started coding in HTML and CSS when I took a CodeAtUni front-end development bootcamp. It was a 3 day coding course that helped me learn the basics of front-end web design and a little bit of javascript. I learned about Founders and Coders 5 days before the deadline but luckily I had already done some of the prerequisites on my own. I got to work and managed to complete and submit my code and coursework before the deadline. My interesting fact is that I am a Level 2 NZSIA qualified ski instructor.</p><hr />

			<h2>Why I applied</h2>
			<hr />
			<p id="about">I applied to this course because I believe that coding is an incredibly powerful and useful skill. I think that with coding it is possible to make many ideas into reality and to help people worldwide. As a russian I know there are many issues in my country and I think that I am very privileged to get to see this but not have to live in it. I would like to learn coding not only for work but also to be able to help the right voices in Russia be heard. That is why I want to code, to be able to make a difference where I can. As to why I chose Founders and Coders? Well the answer is simple. I really love the cooprative ethos of the community you have created. I am a huge fan of working in groups and the ability to share knowlege and learn together is something that I find incredible. This is why I would like to learn to keep learning to code with Founders and Coders. I honestly believe in your mission and would love to be a part of it. I look forward to hearing from you!</p><hr />
